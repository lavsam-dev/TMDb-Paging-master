## Features
* MVVM Architecture.
* Jetpack Libraries and Architecture Components.

## Prerequisites

Add your [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API key in the `local.properties` file:
```
tmdb_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Testing
Local unit testing is done for Movie, TVShow and Search [PageKeyRepositories](https://github.com/Ali-Rezaei/TMDb-Paging/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/sample/android/tmdb/paging/BasePageKeyRepository.kt), Movie and TVShow [DetailViewModels](https://github.com/Ali-Rezaei/TMDb-Paging/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/sample/android/tmdb/ui/detail/DetailViewModel.kt) as well as [PersonViewModel](https://github.com/Ali-Rezaei/TMDb-Paging/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/sample/android/tmdb/ui/person/PersonViewModel.kt).

## Libraries
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
   * [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
   * [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) is a Library in the support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
   * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components updating app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) is an image loading and caching library for Android.
* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for Java, Kotlin, and Android.
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is a library for composing asynchronous code using observable sequences.
* [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) is a module that adds the minimum classes to RxJava to make writing reactive components in Android.
* [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) Executing code asynchronously.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is a Type-safe HTTP client for Android, Java and Kotlin by Square.
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) is a serialization/deserialization library to convert objects into JSON and back.
* [OkHttp interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor) Logs HTTP requests and responses.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/) Build beautiful, usable products using Material Components for Android.
* [MotionLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/motionlayout) helps to manage motion and widget animation.
* [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) which is the most popular Mocking framework for unit tests written in Java as well as Kotlin.
* [MockK](https://mockk.io/ANDROID.html) mocking library for Kotlin
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) Automated testing UI test
